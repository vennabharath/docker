remove docker and install 

-------------------------

Uninstall old versions
Older versions of Docker were called docker or docker-engine. If these are installed, uninstall them, along with associated dependencies.

 sudo yum remove docker \
                  docker-client \
                  docker-client-latest \
                  docker-common \
                  docker-latest \
                  docker-latest-logrotate \
                  docker-logrotate \
                  docker-engine
Itâ€™s OK if yum reports that none of these packages are installed.

Install using the repository
Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker from the repository.

Set up the repository
Install the yum-utils package (which provides the yum-config-manager utility) and set up the repository.

 sudo yum install -y yum-utils
 sudo yum-config-manager \
    --add-repo \
    https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
Install Docker Engine
Install the latest version of Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose or go to the next step to install a specific version:

 sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin

After searching for a long time, I finally found a solution:

Find the file root_.repo in the /etc/yum.repos.d directory after opening
Change enabled=1 to  enabled=0
